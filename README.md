This a just a small project I made during my class 12. It included a lot of elements including GUI with python, sql database and connectivity with python along with file handling, etc
Make sure you have all modules installed along with sql client. Update the database credentials according to your credentials. Also the scale has been set for 1920X1080 resolution with display scale set to 100%. So change your display settings accordingly.
start the project with start.py file
